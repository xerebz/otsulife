Otsu Life
===========

The goal of this project is to get the Legendary Vanquisher title in a relatively automatic fashion. This means kill every mob in every explorable zone in the game on hard mode before your team wipes at -60% death penalty.

This program uses image processing techniques to extract information from Guild Wars 1 and uses AI techniques to travel through the maps.

The team build used is a self-sufficient, robust team of 7 heroes with plenty of minions and spirits to take on just about every threat in the game even when manmode charging into enemy teams.

Dependencies
===========

Guild Wars 1 only runs on Windows, so that'll probably be the most inconvenient prerequisite :).
- [opencv-python](http://opencv.org/)
- [pywin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/)
- [PyUserInput](https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInput) `pip install pyuserinput`
- [pillow] `pip install pillow`
- [pyscreenshot] `pip install pyscreenshot`

Installation
